# Donacious

This is a project for [Philly Codefest'15](http://phillycodefest.com/) with collaborations from Diana Martschenko and John Sun. We realize that there lacks a medium in which indiviudals could donate their used physical goods to those institutions in need. Thus, We want to create an online crowdsourcing platform, especially for non-profits and underresourced schools. Through Donacious, individuals are able to post their used physical goods info on the platform and allow others to easily access them. As a result, Donacious will facilitate the process of communication between donators and receivers, and assist those in need.
